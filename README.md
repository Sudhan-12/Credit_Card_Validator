# Credit_Card_Validator
C++ was used to create the Credit Card Validator application. It uses the Luhn algorithm to verify the credit card number and identify the type of credit card. 
The C++ programming language was used to create a Credit Card Validator application that verifies the validity of a user's credit card number.
It uses the Luhn algorithm to determine whether a credit card number is legitimate or not.
After entering the credit card number, the system verifies its validity and determines whether it is a Visa, MasterCard, American Express or another form of card. 
It verifies the authenticity of the card and the type of credit card by performing some basic operations and validations. Credit card numbers entered by the user are generated along with a message indicating whether the card is valid or invalid.
If the credit card number entered is valid, the credit card type will also be printed.This Project is done using  Obeject Oriented Programming.
